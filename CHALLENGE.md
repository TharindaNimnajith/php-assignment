# Random K9s

*This exercise involves application logic, seeding data and developing an API endpoint.*

Recently one of our partner veterinary clinics “K9 Squad” requested us to build them a small application to serve an
interesting random fact about dogs on their client facing software to make it more attractive.

During the requirement capturing phases, our business analysts have figured out that:

1. There are some numberphiles using their software and prefer to see these random acts with numbers.
2. There is a second group of people who prefer not to see any numbers in the facts.
3. The rest of the users users don't really mind whether there are numbers or not.

It has been also identified that we can use the data from https://github.com/DucNgn/Dog-Facts-API-v2/blob/main/data.json
for seeding our PoC application.

Since you are a new and promising software engineer, the development team would like to give you the opportunity to have
a go at it.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to design and develop a proof-of-concept (PoC) API endpoint that will
respond with a random fact for every request based on the user's preference to have or not have numbers with the facts.

**Instructions**

- Branch off from `master` and commit the code to your branch.
- Submit a pull-request from your branch to the `master` branch.
- Make sure to include a README with the set-up instructions.

**For extra point**

- Include the necessary automated tests.

**For more extra points**

- Document the developed API using a documentation format you are familiar with.
